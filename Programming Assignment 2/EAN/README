European goods have a specific barcode attributed to them which is slightly different than US barcodes.
This program evaluates the "check digit" for European barcodes, which determines if the barcode itself is correct.
This is done by running all but the last digit in the barcode through an algorithm, which, if correct, should return the final digit.
